## Setup Experience
- *Onboarding tour for new users explaining the concept*
- *First-run wizard*: current needs overhaul - talks about "current balance" when date could be in past
  - Ideas for new:
    - When do you want to start tracking?" (date picker)
    - How much cash did you have on [date]?
    - Optional - "Do you have any savings to track?"
    - how often do you get paid?
    - How much do you get paid?
    - *Clearer language throughout*


## Misc
- Always display scroll bar on tables when rows are overflow hidden

- Forms on mobile, when clicking amount field it zooms in, maybe happens on other forms too.
